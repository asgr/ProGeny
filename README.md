# ProGeny

**ProGeny** is a stellar population library (SPL) that generates highly flexible simple/single stellar populations (SSPs) that can be directly loaded into the spectral energy distribution (SED) generating and fitting code **ProSpect**.

Details will be added over time, but the base package can be installed from this repo. You will then need to download the desired isochrones and stellar atmospheres with *progenyAtmosDownload* and *progenyIsoDownload*.
